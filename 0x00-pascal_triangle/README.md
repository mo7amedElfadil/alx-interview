# 0x00-pascal_triangle

In this project we implement the famous Pascal's Triangle. The code was written
in python.

## What is Pascal's Triangle?

Pascal's triangle is an arrangement of binomial coefficients in triangular form.
It is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal. The numbers in
Pascal's triangle are placed in such a way that each number is the sum of two 
numbers just above the number. Pascals triangle is used widely in probability 
theory, combinatorics, and algebra. It is used to find the likelihood of the
outcome of the toss of a coin, coefficients of binomial expansions in probability, etc.
The number of elements in the nth row is equal to (n + 1) elements.
Pascal's triangle can be constructed by writing 1 as the first and the last
element of a row and the other elements of the row are obtained from the sum 
of the two consecutive elements of the previous row. Pascal's triangle can be
constructed easily by just adding the pair of successive numbers in the preceding
lines and writing them in the new line.
